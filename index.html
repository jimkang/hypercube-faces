      The hypercube is a 4-dimensional cube. You may have seen visualizations of
      it that look like this:
    </p>
    <img alt="The popular tesseract image" />
    <p>
      The tesseract image is useful for showing you how the vertices in a
      hypercube can connect to form 8 different 3D cubes. (There's the inner
      cube, the outer cube, then 6 cubes connecting the inner cube to the outer
      cube.) Without context, this image can be misleading. The 6 connecting
      cubes are drawn using lines that A) are not at right angles to each other
      and B) appear to be lines in 3D space. A casual scroller might think, oh,
      the hypercube is just two nested cubes with lines connecting them.
    </p>
    <p>But that's not what it is.</p>
    <p>
      The hypercube has "depth" in a fourth dimension which is imaginary.
      (AFAIK; please <a href="mailto:jimkang@fastmail.com">let me know</a> if
      the fourth dimension has been proven to be real.) Even if it is not
      imaginary, we can't see it because we can only perceive 3D. The lines
      moving along that fourth dimension (assuming the hypercube we're talking
      about has edges parallel to the x, y, z, and w axes) are actually
      perpendicular to edges along the first three dimensions (where
      perpendicularity is tested by getting the dot product of the edges that
      might be perpendicular to each other and verifying that the dot product is
      0).
    </p>
    <p>So, what could we actually perceive about a hypercube?</p>
    <p>
      If you do the Flatland thing and think about someone that can only
      perceive 2D, what could they perceive about a 3D cube? They could see the
      faces as squares when the cube is in certain "cardinal" positions (edges
      parallel to axes). So, we 3D perceivers could can see the faces of a
      hypercube as cubes when it is in cardinal positions.
    </p>
    <p>TODO: Tweening between positions</p>
    <p>
      It's analagous to the hypersquare, which we usually think of as
      "traditional" cubes. Just as all of the faces of the hypersquare are
      squares, all of the faces of the hypercube are (traditional) cubes. These
      cube faces are 3D, which is different from the 2D faces we're used to
      think of when we think of traditional cubes, so we have to think of what
      we mean by a face.
